    <h1>Soil Erosion</h1>

    <p>All land use activities, particularly those which are poorly managed, involve destruction or disturbance, to a greater or lesser extent, of natural and semi-natural ecosystems. Almost invariably, however, it is those ecosystems, in equilibrium with their environment, which offer most effective protection to the soil that supports them.</p>

    <p>A major consequence of ecosystem destruction and disturbance is that of soil degradation. This has been defined as the decline in soil quality caused through its misuse by human activity. More specifically it refers to the decline in soil productivity through adverse changes in nutrient status, organic matter structural stability and concentrations of electrolytes and toxic chemicals.</p>

    <p>Soil degradation incorporates a number of environmental problems, some of which are interrelated, including erosion compaction, water excess and deficit, acidification, salinization and sodification and toxic accumulation of agricultural chemicals and urban/industrial pollutants.</p>

    <p>In many instances, these have led to a serious decline in soil quality and productivity and it is only in recent decades that the finite nature of soil as a resource has become widely recognised. Soil degradation is not a new phenomenon. Archeological evidence suggests that it has been on-going since the beginning of settled agriculture several thousand years ago.

    <h2>Occurrence of Soil Erosion</h2>
    <p>Soil erosion occurs when the rate of removal of soil by water and/or wind exceeds the rate of soil formation. Generally, rates of soil formation are very low, with profiles developing at a rate of about 1 cm every 100-400 years; assuming an average bulk density of 1.33g cm-3, this equates to about 0.3 â€“ 1.3 t ha-1 a-1.</p>

    <p>It is important to differentiate between natural or background erosion and erosion which has been accelerated largely as a result of human activity.</p>

    <p>Some of the highest soil erosion rates have been observed in the Loess Plateau area of China and in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, where values in excess of 200 t ha-1 a-1 have been recorded. Similarly, in India, gully erosion results in a loss of about 8,000 ha of land per year.</p>
